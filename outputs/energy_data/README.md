# Energy data outputs

This directory gathers the raw energy reports generated by the example tutorials so they are easy to find (and publish) without digging through the notebook folders.

| File | Source tutorial | Details |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alpha_carbon_energy.data` | `tutorials/basic/01-AlphaCarbon/coarseGrainedSBM.ipynb` | The per-step SBM reporter output for the alpha-carbon coarse-grained simulation (Energy + force groups). |
| `free_energy_profile_energy_01.data` | `tutorials/basic/04-FreeEnergySurface/freeEnergyProfile.ipynb` | First replicate energy trace used to build the free-energy surface analysis. |
| `multi_basin_energy_01.data` | `tutorials/basic/05-MultiBasin/multiBasinModel.ipynb` | Primary energy output used when comparing the custom multi-basin model states. |
